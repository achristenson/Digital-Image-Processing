# Digital-Image-Processing
This repository contains the code for my digital image processing class, taken Spring '17 taught by Professor Eric Miller.

Originally written in Matlab, I may port it to python later and upload the pdf of the solutions to the problem sets.

Topics covered in:

Problem Set 1
  Lexicographic ordering
  Pixel distances (Euclidean, 4 and 8 nearest neighbor methods)
  Boundary conditions: periodic extending and zero-padding
  Histogram calculation
  Histogram equalization - by parts and dynamic
  Image transformation - rotation, translation, shearing
  
Problem Set 2
  Image morphology
    Erosion
    Dilation
    Opening
    Closing
    Thinning
    Finding skeletons
    Denoising
  Reconstruction by dilation
  Finding connected components
  Closing by reconstruction
  Reconstruction by erosion
  2D convolution
  
Problem Set 3
  2D convolution with zero-padding and periodic boundaries
  Building a homemade conv2 (the built in matlab function for 2D convolution
  Template matching w/convolution
  Gaussian noise filters
  
Problem Set 4
  2D Fourier transforms
  Discrete cosine transform - DCT-II and DCT-III
  Rough approximation of JPEG compression
  Gradient based filtering
  Steerable filters
